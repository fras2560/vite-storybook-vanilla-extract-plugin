Trying to reproduce issue

## Storybook Loading Issue
```bash
yarn install
yarn storybook
```

Will see error in console `Internal server error: No CSS for file` and spinner in storybook.


## Vitest CI issue
Another issue encountered is the interactions test works fine in storybook interaction tab but fails when running from command line `yarn test:storybook`.
